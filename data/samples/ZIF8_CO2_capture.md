# ZIF-8 for CO₂ Capture and Gas Separation

**Reference:** Banerjee et al., *Science*, 2008; Bae & Snurr, *Angewandte Chemie*, 2011.

ZIF-8 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8) is composed of Zn²⁺ ions coordinated with 2-methylimidazolate linkers, forming a sodalite topology.

## Key Properties
- Surface area: 1600–1800 m²/g
- Pore aperture: 3.4 Å (gate opening up to 4.0 Å)
- High chemical stability in water and organic solvents.

## CO₂ Adsorption
- Strong CO₂ affinity via imidazolate nitrogen sites.
- Moderate isosteric heat of adsorption (25–30 kJ/mol).
- CO₂/N₂ selectivity ~10–15 at 298 K.
- Excellent recyclability over >50 adsorption–desorption cycles.

**Modifications:**
- ZIF-8@Ionic Liquid (IL) composites enhance CO₂ uptake by 20–30%.
- Amino-functionalized ZIF-8 improves CO₂ affinity and selectivity.
