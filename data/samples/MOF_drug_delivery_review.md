# Review: Metal–Organic Frameworks in Drug Delivery

**Reference:** Simon-Yarza et al., *Chemical Society Reviews*, 2017.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a versatile class of materials for biomedical applications due to their tunable pore size, functionalizable linkers, and high surface area.

## Key Advantages
- Adjustable pore environments for molecular encapsulation.
- Controlled release kinetics via linker modification.
- Potential for stimuli-responsive behavior (pH, light, redox).

## Representative Systems
| MOF | Metal Center | Drug | Feature |
|-----|---------------|------|----------|
| UiO-66 | Zr⁴⁺ | Ibuprofen, DOX | Biocompatible, stable |
| MIL-100 | Fe³⁺ | Caffeine, 5-FU | Fast degradation in acidic media |
| ZIF-8 | Zn²⁺ | Curcumin | pH-sensitive release |

## Challenges
- Cytotoxicity and biodegradation control.
- Scalable synthesis with pharmaceutical-grade consistency.
