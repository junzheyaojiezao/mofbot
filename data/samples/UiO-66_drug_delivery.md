# UiO-66 and its Applications in Drug Delivery

**Reference:** Horcajada et al., *Chemical Reviews*, 2012; Férey et al., *Accounts of Chemical Research*, 2011.

UiO-66 is a zirconium-based metal–organic framework (MOF) composed of Zr₆O₄(OH)₄ nodes and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) linkers. 
It exhibits high thermal and chemical stability due to strong Zr–O coordination bonds.

## Structural Features
- Topology: fcu (face-centered cubic)
- Surface area: ~1200–1500 m²/g
- Pore diameter: 6–12 Å (depending on linker functionalization)
- Stability: Highly resistant to water, acids, and bases.

## Drug Delivery Applications
- High loading capacity for anticancer drugs (e.g., doxorubicin, ibuprofen).
- Surface functionalization with amino (-NH₂) or carboxyl (-COOH) groups enhances drug–MOF interactions.
- Controlled release behavior: pH-responsive and tunable via linker substitution.
- Demonstrated good biocompatibility and cytotoxicity profiles.

**Example Reaction:** UiO-66-NH₂ + DOX → UiO-66-NH₂@DOX (loading ~15 wt%)
